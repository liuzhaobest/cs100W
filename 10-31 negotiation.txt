strongly recommended
few other candidates
concerned about you taking a job elsewhere
you have very relevant education, skills and experience
you have several offeres
you have strongly sold your value to employer
come to HR as a resource, not to sell them as a person, you need skill set

it is better to apporach negotiations for an entry level position with limited expectations and a shorter list of must haves
